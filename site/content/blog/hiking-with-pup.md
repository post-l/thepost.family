**Ready?**

Research the hike you want to try out; How long will it take? Is it dog friendly? What kind of terrain to expect - Remember, concrete can be hot on pup paws in the heat of the summer

Make sure your pup is prepared for his first “proper” hike. Practice longer walks and change up your route

**Set?**

Got everything you need? We always bring the essentials; Water, collapsible bowl, wet wipes (for when Pastis gets particularly excited by rivers, puddles and muddy areas in general!), poo bags, 

Weather Check- If it’s going to be a little chilly, pack a little sweater for your pup; likewise, if it’s going to be sunny make sure you have extra water supplies

Be prepared to carry pup if he gives up halfway through the hike

**GO!**

Some of our fav Northern California Hikes - 

[Fremont Open Space Preserve ](https://www.openspace.org/preserves/fremont-older)

This is our go-to hiking spot with its incredible views of Silicon Valley, a variety of shorter and longer trail options, and of course the many pups we meet each time we visit. This is always a winner, mainly due to the overlapping trails that allow for last minute changes- meaning we can cut things shorter if Pastis is tired, or switch onto a longer trail if we’re feeling adventurous.

[Devils Slide](https://parks.smcgov.org/devils-slide-trail)

A beautiful trail along a former segment of Highway 1, this is the perfect wake-up walk with a blast of fresh coastal air. The trail itself is concrete with little shade so be wary on hot days. Take a little detour just past the trail to get a closer look at the precarious Devil’s Slide Bunker.

[Almaden Quicksilver County Park](https://www.sccgov.org/sites/parks/parkfinder/pages/almadenpark.aspx)

With over 37 miles of hiking trails to explore, this is another big hit with Pastis. The beautiful scenery complete with remnants of mining structures make it an interesting hike for both pup and parents. Pastis especially loves to stop by the river to cool down on warmer days!
