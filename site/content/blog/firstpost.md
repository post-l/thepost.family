Pastis is named after Ricard Pastis de Marseille, because what's better than alcohol and puppies?

When he isn't sleeping or eating, Pastis loves to explore and make new friends, all whilst representing the best brands. <a href="mailto:pastis@thepost.family" target="_top">Let us know</a> if you would like to collaborate!
